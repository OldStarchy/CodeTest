	 * eg. "file.txt" -> "file.txt.1"
	 *
	 * When a file already exists at the backup location, it will be renamed
	 * with the next available suffix.
	 * eg. "file.txt.1" -> "file.txt.2", "file.txt.2" -> "file.txt.3"
	 *
	 * The maximum number of backups to keep is specified by the maxBackups
	 * parameter.
	 *
	 * This way the lowest numbered backup is the most recent.
	 *
	 * This is primarily used to keep log files from getting too big.
	 *
	 * @param file The file to backup.
	 * @param maxBackups The maximum number of backups to keep.
	 * @returns True if the backup was successful, false otherwise.
	 * @throws Error if the file does not exist or could not be read
